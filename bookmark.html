            <p>
                VVS Laxman, the chief guest of the tournament, is a legendary former Indian cricketer known for his elegant batting and match-winning performances. 
                Born in Hyderabad, he was one of India's most dependable middle-order batsmen, especially in Test cricket. Laxman is best remembered for his iconic 281-run knock against Australia at Eden Gardens in 2001, which is considered one of the greatest Test innings of all time. His ability to play under pressure and guide India to historic victories earned him immense respect in the cricketing world. After retiring from international cricket, Laxman has contributed to the game as a mentor, commentator, and coach, currently serving as the Director of Cricket at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). 
                His presence at the tournament will be an inspiration for young cricketers, encouraging them to work hard and pursue their dreams in the sport.
