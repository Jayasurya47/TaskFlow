        <p>AB de Villiers, often referred to as ABD, is one of the greatest cricketers
           of all time, known for his exceptional batting skills and innovative shot-making. Born on February 17, 1984, in South Africa, he made his international debut in 2004 and quickly became a key player for the Proteas. ABD was famous for his 360-degree batting, effortlessly playing shots all around the ground and dominating bowlers in all formats. His ability to switch gears, from steady innings to explosive hitting, made him a fan favorite. Over his career, he set multiple records, including the fastest 50, 100, and 150 in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Apart from batting, he was also an outstanding fielder and a reliable wicketkeeper. ABD played a crucial role in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), where his partnerships with Virat Kohli became legendary. Even after retiring from international cricket in 2018, his influence on the game remains strong, and fans still admire his sportsmanship and genius on the field.
